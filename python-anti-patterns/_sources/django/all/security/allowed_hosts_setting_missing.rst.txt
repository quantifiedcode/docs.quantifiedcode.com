ALLOWED_HOSTS setting missing
=============================

In Django, you need to properly set the ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` setting when ``DEBUG = False``. This is a security mechanism. It prevents attackers from poisoning caches or password reset emails with links to malicious hosts by submitting requests with a fake HTTP Host header, which is possible even under many seemingly-safe web server configurations.

Anti-Pattern
------------

``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` not set or empty, when ``DEBUG = False``.

.. code:: python

    """ settings.py """

    DEBUG = False
    # ...
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = []

Best practice
-------------

Make sure, an appropriate host is set in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, whenever `DEBUG = False`.

.. code:: python

    DEBUG = False
    # ...
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['djangoproject.com']
