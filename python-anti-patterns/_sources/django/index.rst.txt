:fa:`book` Django
=================

Django is a great framework to create fast and scalable web applications. To help you write great Django apps from the start, we started to compile a set of anti- and migration patterns. They'll help you to avoid common mistakes or to migrate to a new version faster. Some patterns are simply (more elaborate) explanations of tips and best practices that can be found in Django's docs. Others stem from our own experiences. Feel free to contribute your ideas or share your pattern via `email <mailto:info@quantifiedcode.com?subject=New%20pattern&body=Hey%20fellow%20Pythoneer%2C%0A%0Athanks%20for%20suggesting%20a%20new%20pattern.%20To%20help%20us%20understand%20you%20pattern%2C%20please%20send%20us%20the%20following%20information%3A%0A%0ADescription%3A%20what%20is%20the%20pattern%20all%20about%20and%20why%20is%20it%20a%20problem%3F%0AAnti-pattern%3A%20Code%20snippet%20that%20shows%20the%20problem%0ABest-practice%3A%20Code%20snippet%20that%20shows%20the%20solution%20%2F%20best%20practice%0AReferences%20(optional)%3A%20Links%20to%20further%20readings%0A%0AThanks%2C%20%0AAndreas%20and%20Christoph>`_.
