Implementing Java-style getters and setters
===========================================

Python is not Java. If you need to set or get the members of a class or object, just expose the member publicly and access it directly. If you need to perform some computations before getting or setting the member, then use Python's built-in ``property`` decorator.

Anti-pattern
------------

The programmer below comes to Python from a long career as a Java programmer. For every class member that he wants to expose publicly, he defines a ``get`` and ``set`` method for that member. This is common practice in Java, but is frowned upon in Python as a waste of time and a cause of unnecessary code.

.. code:: python

    class Square(object):
        def __init__(self, length):
            self._length = length
        # Java-style
        def get_length(self):
            return self._length
        # Java-style
        def set_length(self, length):
            self._length = length

    r = Square(5)
    r.get_length()
    r.set_length(6)

Best practice
-------------

Access the members directly
...........................

In Python it is acceptable to simply access class or object members directly. The modified code below exposes the ``length`` member as a public member. This is signified by the fact that there is no underscore character at the beginning of the member name. The ``get_length()`` and ``set_length()`` methods are no longer necessary so they have been deleted.

.. code:: python

    class Square(object):
        def __init__(self, length):
            self.length = length

    r = Square(5)
    r.length
    r.length = 6

Use built-in ``property`` decorator
...................................

When a member needs to be slightly protected and cannot be simply exposed as a public member, use Python's ``property`` decorator to accomplish the functionality of getters and setters.

.. code:: python

    class Square(object):
        def __init__(self, length):
            self._length = length

        @property
        def length(self):
            return self._length

        @length.setter
        def length(self, value):
            self._length = value

        @length.deleter
        def length(self):
            del self._length

    r = Square(5)
    r.length  # automatically calls getter
    r.length = 6  # automatically calls setter
